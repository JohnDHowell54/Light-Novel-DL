# Light-Novel-DL
I was tired of going to all the different websites and getting my eyes assaulted with ads and light themes.
# Current Features
Right now the script only saves the external links in text files in my Light_Novel directory in the home directory

# Future Features
My end goal is to download each chapter in an appropriately named textfile that can be read in my terminal using the less command. I have the output already figured out with Lynx just need to get the rest of the script up to snuff over the next week or two.
